The following document contains information, details and explanations of the following Pintos1 project, and code.  The following program will wake up tests, put them in priority either through the normal priority scheduler, or the MLFQS scheduler.

 Consulted by using the Pintos Manual and the Project1 PDF
 given to us by Ivo Georgiev


			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

 Bool: sleeping_thread_compare: disables interupts and compares wake time and priority

 Static Struct: list_time_based_sleeping_thread_list: Sets up the timer to interrupt TIMER_FREQ times per second,
 and registers the corresponding interrupt
 
 void: timer_sleep(): Wakes and sleeps semaphores

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

 In a call to timer_sleep(), it will disable interrupts so as to be able to tell how many ticks it will take for a thread to finish.
 creates a sleeping_thread for the cur_thread.
 Will create semaphore called wake_up and set it to cur_thread
 will then create a wake.time for the cur_thread
 Finally it will create a list for the sleeping threads, and put them down until they are called to wake up.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

It will set the amount of ticks in timer_ticks to int64_t.  Then it will create an old_level component that will disable
the timer interrupt. 
 With the timer interrupt disabled, we will see if the list is empty, and if it is, we will break out and call the timer interrupt. 
 Else we will create a struct list_elem *e;  The sleeping thread list will then be put into this.  We also check to ensure we 
 put in the correct threads, so as to not run into an issue with timer_sleep.
 Next, we see if the wake.time is less than or equal to the current ticks, and if so we wake up the thread, and if not then we 
 re-enable the timer_interrupt

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

 Race conditions of multiple threads calling timer_sleep are prevented by giving priority to a thread and then also putting 
 it into an ordered list.  The ordered list will only pop off one thread at a time into the sleeping thread list

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

 race conditions are avoided by setting the wake time to be less than or equal to the current tick number.  If the current tick is
 greater than the wake time or equal to it, then we wake up threads in the list one at a time, according to their expected wake time.
 This will prevent it as the list only pops one test in at a time, and ensures that the test is finished before going into the next 
 test.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

 We chose this design because it was easy and structured to implement.  It ensures the minimum time that timer interrupt is 
 called and then also ensures that threads are waking up in the order of priority that they have.  It will ensure that threads
 come in priority order, and execute without delays.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

priority_thread_compare is mainly used in semaphores

priority_thread_compare_largest_first is used only in thread.c to resort the scheduler ready list

priority_sema_compar is only used for comparing the semaphores in conditional veribles 

the sema_down() is simmilar i think theres an uneccessary sort() in there, but oh well

sema_up() olny gets the highest thread and wakes that up

priority_donate() I tried to explain in its comments

return_priority() has incorrect comments. The threads do not fight over the lock anymore, the lower priority doner is removed from within priority_donate()

insted return_priority() now gets any thread that was waiting on the lock that is just about to be released, removes it and sets its waiting_on member to null it also sets the priority of the lock holder to that of either the highest priority donor that did NOT donate to aquire the lock that is about to be released, if no such donor exists it sets the holders priority to its origional priority

lock_aquire() now sets the calling threads waiting_on the the current lock, and then calls priority_donate() It also has checks to abvoid this if the lock is free to aquire

lock_release() now calls return_priority()

cond_wait() dosent do much else

cond_signal() sorts the list of waiters before waking up the highest

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

The data structure tracks down priority donation by going through each thread and checking the priority.  To ensure busy waiting is not happening, it will put it in a list that then allows prority to be traversed through each thread so that threads can execute in correct order (I.E. Threads that wake up first, are the first to execute).  After that, it will return priority as needed to threads so that the threads end up finishing in the order they need to.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

The highest Priority thread will wake up first because due to the algorithm set up, we have it to always pull the highest prority first, and then go through other prorities and decide if a lower priority thread needs to give up it's spot to the higher prority thread through donation.  After donation is finished, and thread has finished or not encountered busy waiting, donation will be given back unless another higher prority thread needs to execute before the lower priority thread that donation was borrowed from.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

A thread will call to lock_aquire and cause itself to be locked out.  At which point, the prority scheduler will petition the lock to have the thread donate it's priority if a thread with higher prority comes along.  When the thread with higher prority comes along, it will donate its prority to the lower prority so that it can get into the lock_acquire() stage.  nested donation is handled the same way (so for example, if multiple high prority threads come along, they will donate the highest prority upwards and then take it back when they need to execute.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

When the lock_release() occurs, the higher-priority thread will immediately grab up the opportunity.  If priority donation needs to happen, it will occur before the lock releases.  Once the lock release is completed, the thread will be assumed to be finished.  If a higher-prority thread needs to use Lock_release, it will donate it's priority to the function that is blocking it, and allow itself through after that donated thread has finished.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

A potential race condition in thread_set_priority() is possible if two highly prioritized threads come at the same time and they end up having the same priority.  Our implementation ensures that if this scenario occurs, it will donate only one of the priority's as we have a condition ensure that the priority being donated is not of the same level as the current thread's priority.  You can use a lock to avoid this race, but you may potentially slow down the implementation of thread_set_priority if you do so.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We choose this design more because we struggled with priority overall, and decided that our original implementation was not working because we had no way to ensure that the current priority was not the same as one trying to be donated.  Once we figured that out, everything ended up working smoothly.  It is superior to the previous iterations due to the fact that it accounts for all scenarios in priority donation, and ensures that the most efficient route is taken.

This was added to thread.c as a temporary variable for storing ready_threads recalculations.
> static int32_t ready_threads;

This was added to thread.c to store the average number of ready threads over the past minute.
> static fixedreal_t load_avg;            

This was added to the thread struct to store each thread's recent_cpu value:

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

This assignment was really difficult.  It is uncertain as if it was too easy or too hard, but it definitely bordered a lot closer to the hard side of assignments we have done int he past.  It took a considerable amount of time and man hours to implement all of the three problems.  In our opinion, there should be better clarification of what the MLFQS is actually trying to do up front instead of having to wait a week or two into the assignment to find out what is expected of it.  We find that this assignment is also exceptionally difficult with only having the professor to turn to in times of need.  While Slack is great for some questions, it'd be great to have more people to be able to ask about the assignment and get help/guidance when we end up lost along the path.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

We found out that working on the regular priority scheduler ended up leaving a great deal of insight about how an OS can get locked up, stuck in busy waiting, or have problems with priority donation if not implemented properly.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

Give the hint about how priority works earlier on in development rather than later on.  That was the single most greatest help to us in our development criteria.  Also, there should be a bigger hint about the MLFQS rather than just "google how it should be implemented".

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

One suggestion for the TA is to be able to attend some class periods so that if students come for questions, the TA is understanding about what is expected from the professor rather than just going by the grading rubric.

>> Any other comments?

Overall, this is large to do, and if teams of 2 people are having issues, then maybe the teams should be bigger. 3 seems to be a much more manageable size than just 2.  We believe that the C programming assignments are quite a giant step down from Pintos, and as such, require much less team size.  In the future, teams should be designed around the first Pintos assignment instead of the C assignments.
